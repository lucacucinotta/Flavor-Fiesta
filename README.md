## Introduction to Project

**Flavor Fiesta** is a webpage where, by entering the name of the recipe or just a keyword, you'll be able to see a series of recipes ready for being cooked.

### Project's Purpose

I've create that webpage to practice with React, an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Thanks to this project I was able to put into practice what I studied about React and what surrounds it, such as React Function Components, React Hooks, React Query Hooks and CSS Modules for styling.

## Usage

The webpage is really intuitive. At the very least, you can search a recipe by entering the name or just a keyword : then you'll have a series of recipes at your disposal containing various information about them : name, recipe's creator, kcalories, ingredients and, by clicking on the DIET button at the top left, you'll have access to all the diets of wich the recipe is part.
